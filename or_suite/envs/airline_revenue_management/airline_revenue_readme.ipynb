    "## Description\n",
    "One potential application of reinforcement learning involves managing different available resources consumed by different classes of customers to maximize revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "The revenue management problem addresses the problem by modeling an environment where there are multiple types of resources with the same initial availability. There is also a deadline for each resource to be purchased. Different classes of customers arrive and wish to purchase different numbers of each resource, but the agent can choose whether or not to accept the customer. The goal of the agent is to choose when to accept different classes of customers to maximize revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step, the agent first chooses whether it will accept or deny each class of cusotmer. Then, one customer (or no customer) will arrive probabilistically. The customer will then be able to purchase the desired resources if accepted, which will be reflected by updating the available number of resources, or they will be denied, in which case the available numbers are not affected. The reward is calculated in correlation to how much the customer purchased of each type of resource (the revenue) or if no purchases were made.\n"

    "## Model Assumptions\n",
    "* Customers who are denied are not allowed to purchase resources later even if those resources are available. This did not extend to customer classes, though. A customer may be allowed to purchase resources even if another customer of the same class was denied at an earlier (or later) timestep."
